TO DO LIST

1. The first step is to create some words I'm going to use and store those words in a text to be use for letter.
2. I would then create a short outline of the code on paper so I could visualize how I'm going to right the code.
3. I could then will start writing the code running it every time I add something new to make sure everything works correctly.
4. I would then make sure that everything works or it's all completed by testing the code multiple times, making sure I always get new word every time I start a new game.
5. The last step would be to double check and see if everything works for the last time and once I make sure everything is in working condition then I would just have to turn the project in.
