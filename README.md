This code will be to create a game of Hangman in which the program will choose a word at random from a file and with that the user will have to figure out what the word is by putting any letter he wants and if he gets it right the letter is added and if the letter is incorrect one life out of five is taken from the user until either the user gets the word right or runs out of life.
