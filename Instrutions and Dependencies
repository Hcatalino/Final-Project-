This project was really fun to make and learn some new things about python, while writing this code I made it so that the other people who would want to wouldn't have a tough time running the code.
There are no specific things you need to do to run the code, you will need a command line like, cmd, powershell, or anything like that to run the program.
The modules that are in the code are only the random module which will allow the program to choose a word at random.
Future Work - One thing I would've want to work more on if I had more time and knowledge would be able to make a hangman everytime the user will get a letter wrong and also trying to create a GUI since most of the other Hangman will have a GUI I would want to try and make it for my code.
